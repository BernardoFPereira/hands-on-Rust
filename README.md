# Hands-on Rust
This repo exits for me to keep track and records of my advancement thought the Hands-on Rust book written by Herbet Wolverson (thebracket).

## Testing Projects
You must have `rust`(cargo) installed in order to run the projects.

Clone the repo, then `cd` into the directory of the project you want to test and `cargo run` it.
