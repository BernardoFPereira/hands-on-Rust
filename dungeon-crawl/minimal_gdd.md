# Minimal GDD

## Name
Crusty Rogue

## Short Description
A dungeon crawler with procedurally generated levels, monsters of increasing difficulty, and turn-based movement.

## Story
The Crust is taking over the world, infecting nature with a hideous course. There is only one thing that can save it. The Amoap relic. Unfortunately it was lost in the Dungeon of Despair, but you are one of the few people that can wield the power of the crust and use if to fight back. You must retrieve the relic and save the world, by any means necessary.

## Basic Game Loops
1. Enter dungeon level.
2. Explore, revealing map.
3. Enconter enemies. Player decides how to engage them or if at all.
4. Find power-ups and items to strengthen the player.
5. Locate exit of the level -- go to 1.

## Minimum Viable Product
1. Create a basic dungeon map
2. Place player character and let it walk around
3. Spawn monsters, draw them and let the player fight them by bumping them
4. Add health and combat systems
5. Add a healing item
6. Display "Game Over" ascreen when player's health reaches 0 (dies)
7. Add the Amaop Relic to the level and let the player win be reaching it

## Stretch Goals
1. Add field-of-view
2. Add more interesting dungeon designs
3. Add some dungeon themes
4. Add multiple layers to the dungeon, with the Relic on the last one
5. Add varied weapons to the game
6. Move to a data-driven design for spawning enemies
7. Consider some visual effect to make combat more visceral
8. Consider keeping score (tombstone files, maybe?)
